Why we need heaps?
Reduced time complexity: Linear data structures such as linked lists or arrays can access the minimum or maximum element present in Big O (n) whereas heaps can access the minimum or maximum element present in Big O (1).
This is crucial while processing large data sets. n refers to the number of data sets.

Application of heaps
They have been used in operating systems for job scheduling on a priority basis.
They are used in Heap sort algorithms to implement priority queues.
Used in the Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest paths.

Conclusion
With a reduced time complexity, min-heap and max-heap are efficient when processing data sets, each with its own use case and implementation.
In this article, we have covered, the min-heap, the max-heap, why we need heaps, and applications of heaps. */
